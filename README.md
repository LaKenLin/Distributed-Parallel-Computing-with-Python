# Distributed Parallel Computing with Python
A project for my "Computational Astrophysics" university course. The goal was to parallelize existing code for simulating blast waves.

The PDF file in the repository gives an overview over the work and the GIF files, which can be viewed directly here on Github, show visualizations of simulated blast waves which are quite beautiful in my humble opinion.

Credit: The modules HD_BLAST.py and MUSCL_2D.py are in large part code that was distributed by the course organizers including the course instructor. \
Other modules in the directory including the code for parallelization were written by the owner of this repository.
