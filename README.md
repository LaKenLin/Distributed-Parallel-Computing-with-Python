# Distributed Parallel Computing with Python
A project for my "Computational Astrophysics" university course. The goal was to parallelize existing code for simulating blast waves.

The PDF file in the repository gives an overview over the work and the GIF files, which can be viewed directly here on Github, show visualizations of simulated blast waves which are quite beautiful in my humble opinion.
